        When you look at the chart on a linear scale, the curve gets steeper and steeper.
        Relax! Growth curves look like that. Take the Dow Jones, a savings account

        With a fixed percentage per time, rising from 1 to 10 takes as long as
        from 100,000 to 1,000,000. Both is the growth by a factor of 10.

        That is why many analysts like to look at charts with a <strong>logarithmic
        scale</strong> where the y-axis scales in orders of magnitude.
